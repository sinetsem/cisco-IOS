Part1:
step2:
 -The switch has 24 Fast Ethernet interfaces.
 -The switch has 2 Gigabit Ethernet interfaces.
 -The range of values show for the vty lines is 0-4 to 5-15.
 -The command will display the current contents non-volatile random access memory(NVRAM) is "startup-config".
 -The switch respond with "startup-config is not present" because the configuration file is not saved to non-volatile random access memory(NVRAM).
Part2
 The login command is required because of the purpose for the password checking process to work.
step7:
 - The enable secret password is displayed "$1$mERr$ILwq/b7kc.7x/ejA4Aosn0".
 - The enable secret password displayed differently form what we configured because it is shown in encrypt form that changed from plain-text password.
step8:
 If we configure any more passwords on the switch, they will be displayed in the configuration file in encryted form because
 the service password-encryption command encrypts all current and future passwords.
Part3:
step1:
 - This banner will be displayed when we enter the switch by the console port.
 - Every switch should have a MOTD banner because it keeps everything that users updated on various activities 
   and it can be used to warn againt un-authorized access.
Part4:
step2:
 Abbreviated version of the copy running-config srartup-config command, the shortest is "copy run start".
step3:
 - The command will display the contents of NVRAM is "startup-config".
 - All the changes that were entered are recorded in the file and it is the same as the running-configuration.
