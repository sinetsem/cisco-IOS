Part1:
step3:
 We can verify that both passwords were configure corrently: after we exit out of user exec mode,
 the switch will prompt us for a password to access the console interface and will prompt us a 
 second password time when we are accessing the priviliged exec mode.
step4:
 s1(config)# exit
 s1# copy running-config startup-config
Part2:
step2:
 b. We were not successful because the switches have not been configure with the IP address.
Part3:
step1:
 -If this is the case, we would configure it with an IP address because an IP address is required to connect to a switch remotely. 
  The switch is managed through VLAN1 by default.
 -we enter the no shutdown because the no shutdown command adminstratively enablees the interface to an active state.
step4:
 The command is used to save the configuration file in RAM to NVRAM is "copy running-config startup-config".
